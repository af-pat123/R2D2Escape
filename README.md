# R2D2Escape

This was a project done with four other members on the RL department of Ryerson Artificial Intelligence. The project uses pybullet to generate an R2D2 agent and a unique maze every time a new world is generated. The observation space is what the robot seen in the last four timesteps and its action space consists of four action(Move Forward, Move Backwards, Rotate Clockwise, Rotate Counter-Clockwise). The optimal was policy was generated using deep reinforcement learning and value iteration.
